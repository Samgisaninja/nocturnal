# Nocturnal

A Control Center module for Eclipse X (iOS 11) and Eclipse Dark Mode (iOS 12)

## Usage
Install the deb and it should appear under your control center modules in Settings.
Will soon be available to Eclipse users!

## Forking, contributing, and learning
This project will remain under it's original license. You may use any code found in this project for 
your own personal use. It provides a great way to disable/enable Eclipse dynamically. Tweaks that extend Eclipse are welcome
to utilize this as a guide. Developers wanting a template to develop their own Control Center modules are welcome to use this as well.

Contributions to the project are welcome as well!
